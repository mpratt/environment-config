Environment Config
==================

I store installation scripts and stuff I use to bootstrap my Operating System.
It takes care of installing packages I need, correcting stuff and some OS dependant scripts.

[Bash, Vim, ZSH and other stuff are stored on my dotfiles repository](https://github.com/mpratt/dotfiles)

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mpratt/environment-config ~/.environment-config
cd ~/.environment-config
bash setup.sh
```
