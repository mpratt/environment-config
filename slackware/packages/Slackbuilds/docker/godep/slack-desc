# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

godep: godep helps build packages reproducibly by fixing their dependencies.
godep: This tool assumes you are working in a standard Go workspace, as 
godep: described in http://golang.org/doc/code.html.  We expect godep to 
godep: build on Go 1.4* or newer, but you can use it on any project that
godep: works with Go 1 or newer.
